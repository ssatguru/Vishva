## about

Vishva - A hindi word for "World"

A simple live scene editor for [BabylonJS](http://www.babylonjs.com/), a 3D HTML Webgl framework.

For demo see [https://ssatguru.github.io/Vishva.ts/public_html/](https://ssatguru.github.io/Vishva.ts/public_html/)

For intro see [http://ssatguru.appspot.com/BabylonJS-Vishva/intro.html](http://ssatguru.appspot.com/BabylonJS-Vishva/intro.html)

For details see [wiki at https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva/wiki](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva/wiki)

Written in TypeScript.

Note:  
The original version was written in Java and then transpiled to TypeScript/JavaScript using JSweet.  
It was originally written in Java, as at that time I wasn't very comfortable with the TypeScript language and ecosystem.  
Over time I have become more comfortable with it.  
The new version is thus written in TypeScript (based on the initial TypeScript code generated by JSweet).  
Porting to Typescript was easy, as JSweet generates human readable TypeScript thus allowing one to switch to TypeScript at any time.  
For those interested, the old java version is still available at [https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva)

## to run

- cd to "public_html" folder. Open "index.html" in browser. If you are using firefox browser then you can open it directly from disk. For others you will have to serve the file via. some http server due to cross origin requests restrictions. See [here for some helpful information](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally)

run  
a) "npm install"  
 this will install any dependencies.
