Written in TypeScript.

Note:  
The original version was written in Java and then transpiled to TypeScript/JavaScript using JSweet.  
It was originally written in Java, as at that time I wasn't very comfortable with the TypeScript language and ecosystem.  
Over time I have become more comfortable with it.  
The new version is thus written in TypeScript (based on the initial TypeScript code generated by JSweet).  
Porting to Typescript was easy, as JSweet generates human readable TypeScript thus allowing one to switch to TypeScript at any time.  
For those interested, the old java version is still available at [https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva)
