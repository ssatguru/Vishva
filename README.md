Demo : [https://ssatguru.github.io/VishvaWorlds-KennyLowPoly/bin](https://ssatguru.github.io/VishvaWorlds-KennyLowPoly/bin).

Documentation : [wiki](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva/wiki).

## to test, build and run

make sure you have typescript installed locally or globally  
run

- npm install  
  this will install any dependencies.

- npm run test  
  this will build in memory, start a webpack-dev-server and open browser at http://localhost:8080  
  if you make any changes to source and save , this will automatically reload your project in the browser.  
  goto "http://localhost:8080/bin/?world=empty" to open an empty world

- npm run build  
  This will create a production build. It will compile,minify and bundle all reuired files into the bin folder.

- to run , start an http server from the root of the project and goto url "http://localhost:8080/bin/?world=empty"
  - url "http://localhost:8080/bin" will also work as he default world in "config.js" is set to "empty"
  - the default character jump animations might require some speed adjustment - lower speed , maybe 0.5 instead of 1

## Notes

The original version was written in Java and then transpiled to TypeScript/JavaScript using JSweet.  
It was originally written in Java, as at that time I wasn't very comfortable with the TypeScript language and ecosystem.  
Over time I have become more comfortable with it.  
The new version is thus written in TypeScript (based on the initial TypeScript code generated by JSweet).  
Porting to Typescript was easy, as JSweet generates human readable TypeScript thus allowing one to switch to TypeScript at any time.  
For those interested, the old java version is still available at [https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva.java](https://github.com/ssatguru/Vishva.java)
