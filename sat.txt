start http-server from root
goto localhost:8080/bin/index.html
this picks up config file from absolute location /vishva
the idea is to run distributable from one folder and the world from another folder



vishva needs 

a) internal assets
these are stored in the build/bin folder.
same place as the index.html file
These are picked up using relative location "assets/..."

b) user assets
these are stored in the "vishva" folder.
These are thus picked up using absolute location "/vishva/.."

See index.html and Vishva.ts vBinHome variable.
In index.html note the <base href="../" />

webpack-dev-server is setup to serve build and static content from  root "./"
webpack will copy all src/assets folder to bin folder.
