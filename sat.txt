start http-server from root
goto localhost:8080/bin/index.html
this picks up config file from absolute location /vishva
the idea is to run distributable from one folder and the world from another folder



vishva needs 

a) internal assets
these are stored in the build/bin folder.
same place as the index.html file
These are picked up using relative location "assets/..."

b) user assets
these are stored in the "vishva" folder.
These are thus picked up using absolute location "/vishva/.."

See index.html and Vishva.ts vBinHome variable.
In index.html note the <base href="../" />

webpack-dev-server is setup to serve build and static content from  root "./"
webpack will copy all src/assets folder to bin folder.


themes
download themes from
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_color_themes.asp
example
w3-theme-eggpant.css

The css itself isn't used.
Instead the color values fromthe css needs to be copied to sr/gui/components/VTheme.ts
a) create a new class say EggPlantTheme which extends VTheme.
b) copy the 10 foreground and background colors from the css to this class
c) set the CurretTheme  to an instance of this new class.
See VTheme.ts for more instructions.
