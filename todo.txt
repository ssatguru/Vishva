bugs

- remove children removes attached light too.
- able to slide dialog box below the screen, 
  turn off "overflow: hidden;" in body css to see why, 
  one solution - init all gui elements
  setting "position:fixed;" instead of "position:absolute"   in gui-item's css seems to help 
  also "display:none" for all jquery ui items
